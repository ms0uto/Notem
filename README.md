Notem project repository.
This is a sample JavaFX project consisting of a small desktop application that enables the user
to keep track of his/her favourites RSS feeds and enables him to read the full document in their
browser with a simple click.

Note: this project is a little bit outdated and i plan to refactor it heavily pretty soon.  =)
